---

# NanoClaw Setup

Run all commands automatically. Only pause when user action is required (scanning QR codes).

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Install Apple Container

Check if Apple Container is installed:

```bash
which container && container --version || echo "Not installed"
```

If not installed, tell the user:
> Apple Container is required for running agents in isolated environments.
>
> 1. Download the latest `.pkg` from https://github.com/apple/container/releases
> 2. Double-click to install
> 3. Run `container system start` to start the service
>
> Let me know when you've completed these steps.

Wait for user confirmation, then verify:

```bash
container system start
container --version
```

**Note:** NanoClaw automatically starts the Apple Container system when it launches, so you don't need to start it manually after reboots.

## 3. Configure Claude Authentication

Ask the user:
> Do you want to use your **Claude subscription** (Pro/Max) or an **Anthropic API key**?

### Option 1: Claude Subscription (Recommended)

Ask the user:
> Want me to grab the OAuth token from your current Claude session?

If yes:
```bash
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.claude/.credentials.json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.claudeAiOauth.accessToken // empty')
if [ -n "$TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=$TOKEN" > .env
  echo "Token configured: ${TOKEN:0:20}...${TOKEN: -4}"
else
  echo "No token found - are you logged in to Claude Code?"
fi
```

If the token wasn't found, tell the user:
> Run `claude` in another terminal and log in first, then come back here.

### Option 2: API Key

Ask if they have an existing key to copy or need to create one.

**Copy existing:**
```bash
grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" /path/to/source/.env > .env
```

**Create new:**
```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=' > .env
```

Tell the user to add their key from https://console.anthropic.com/

**Verify:**
```bash
KEY=$(grep "^ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" .env | cut -d= -f2)
[ -n "$KEY" ] && echo "API key configured: ${KEY:0:10}...${KEY: -4}" || echo "Missing"
```

## 4. Build Container Image

Build the NanoClaw agent container:

```bash
./container/build.sh
```

This creates the `nanoclaw-agent:latest` image with Node.js, Chromium, Claude Code CLI, and agent-browser.

Verify the build succeeded (the `container images` command may not work due to a plugin issue, so we verify by running a simple test):

```bash
echo '{}' | container run -i --entrypoint /bin/echo nanoclaw-agent:latest "Container OK" || echo "Container build failed"
```

## 5. WhatsApp Authentication

**USER ACTION REQUIRED**

Run the authentication script:

```bash
npm run auth
```

Tell the user:
> A QR code will appear. On your phone:
> 1. Open WhatsApp
> 2. Tap **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**
> 3. Scan the QR code

Wait for the script to output "Successfully authenticated" then continue.

If it says "Already authenticated", skip to the next step.

## 6. Configure Assistant Name

Ask the user:
> What trigger word do you want to use? (default: `Andy`)
>
> Messages starting with `@TriggerWord` will be sent to Claude.

If they choose something other than `Andy`, update it in these places:
1. `groups/CLAUDE.md` - Change "# Andy" and "You are Andy" to the new name
2. `groups/main/CLAUDE.md` - Same changes at the top
3. `data/registered_groups.json` - Use `@NewName` as the trigger when registering groups

Store their choice - you'll use it when creating the registered_groups.json and when telling them how to test.

## 7. Register Main Channel

Ask the user:
> Do you want to use your **personal chat** (message yourself) or a **WhatsApp group** as your main control channel?

For personal chat:
> Send any message to yourself in WhatsApp (the "Message Yourself" chat). Tell me when done.

For group:
> Send any message in the WhatsApp group you want to use as your main channel. Tell me when done.

After user confirms, start the app briefly to capture the message:

```bash
timeout 10 npm run dev || true
```

Then find the JID from the database:

```bash
# For personal chat (ends with @s.whatsapp.net)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@s.whatsapp.net' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"

# For group (ends with @g.us)
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT DISTINCT chat_jid FROM messages WHERE chat_jid LIKE '%@g.us' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Create/update `data/registered_groups.json` using the JID from above and the assistant name from step 5:
```json
{
  "JID_HERE": {
    "name": "main",
    "folder": "main",
    "trigger": "@ASSISTANT_NAME",
    "added_at": "CURRENT_ISO_TIMESTAMP"
  }
}
```

Ensure the groups folder exists:
```bash
mkdir -p groups/main/logs
```

## 8. Configure External Directory Access (Mount Allowlist)

Ask the user:
> Do you want the agent to be able to access any directories **outside** the NanoClaw project?
>
> Examples: Git repositories, project folders, documents you want Claude to work on.
>
> **Note:** This is optional. Without configuration, agents can only access their own group folders.

If **no**, create an empty allowlist to make this explicit:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nanoclaw
cat > ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json << 'EOF'
{
  "allowedRoots": [],
  "blockedPatterns": [],
  "nonMainReadOnly": true
}
EOF
echo "Mount allowlist created - no external directories allowed"
```

Skip to the next step.

If **yes**, ask follow-up questions:

### 8a. Collect Directory Paths

Ask the user:
> Which directories do you want to allow access to?
>
> You can specify:
> - A parent folder like `~/projects` (allows access to anything inside)
> - Specific paths like `~/repos/my-app`
>
> List them one per line, or give me a comma-separated list.

For each directory they provide, ask:
> Should `[directory]` be **read-write** (agents can modify files) or **read-only**?
>
> Read-write is needed for: code changes, creating files, git commits
> Read-only is safer for: reference docs, config examples, templates

### 8b. Configure Non-Main Group Access

Ask the user:
> Should **non-main groups** (other WhatsApp chats you add later) be restricted to **read-only** access even if read-write is allowed for the directory?
>
> Recommended: **Yes** - this prevents other groups from modifying files even if you grant them access to a directory.

### 8c. Create the Allowlist

Create the allowlist file based on their answers:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nanoclaw
```

Then write the JSON file. Example for a user who wants `~/projects` (read-write) and `~/docs` (read-only) with non-main read-only:

```bash
cat > ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json << 'EOF'
{
  "allowedRoots": [
    {
      "path": "~/projects",
      "allowReadWrite": true,
      "description": "Development projects"
    },
    {
      "path": "~/docs",
      "allowReadWrite": false,
      "description": "Reference documents"
    }
  ],
  "blockedPatterns": [],
  "nonMainReadOnly": true
}
EOF
```

Verify the file:

```bash
cat ~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json
```

Tell the user:
> Mount allowlist configured. The following directories are now accessible:
> - `~/projects` (read-write)
> - `~/docs` (read-only)
>
> **Security notes:**
> - Sensitive paths (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, credentials) are always blocked
> - This config file is stored outside the project, so agents cannot modify it
> - Changes require restarting the NanoClaw service
>
> To grant a group access to a directory, add it to their config in `data/registered_groups.json`:
> ```json
> "containerConfig": {
>   "additionalMounts": [
>     { "hostPath": "~/projects/my-app", "containerPath": "my-app", "readonly": false }
>   ]
> }
> ```

## 9. Gmail Authentication (Optional)

Ask the user:
> Do you want to enable Gmail integration for reading/sending emails?
>
> **Note:** This requires setting up Google Cloud Platform OAuth credentials, which involves:
> 1. Creating a GCP project
> 2. Enabling the Gmail API
> 3. Creating OAuth 2.0 credentials
> 4. Downloading a credentials file
>
> This takes about 5-10 minutes. Skip if you don't need email integration.

If yes, guide them through the prerequisites:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Enable the Gmail API (APIs & Services → Enable APIs → search "Gmail API")
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID → Desktop app)
5. Download the JSON file and save to `~/.gmail-mcp/gcp-oauth.keys.json`

Then run:
```bash
npx -y @gongrzhe/server-gmail-autoauth-mcp
```

This will open a browser for OAuth consent. After authorization, credentials are cached.

## 10. Configure launchd Service

Generate the plist file with correct paths automatically:

```bash
NODE_PATH=$(which node)
PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd)
HOME_PATH=$HOME

cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist << EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.nanoclaw</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>${NODE_PATH}</string>
        <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/dist/index.js</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:${HOME_PATH}/.local/bin</string>
        <key>HOME</key>
        <string>${HOME_PATH}</string>
    </dict>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>${PROJECT_PATH}/logs/nanoclaw.error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

echo "Created launchd plist with:"
echo "  Node: ${NODE_PATH}"
echo "  Project: ${PROJECT_PATH}"
```

Build and start the service:

```bash
npm run build
mkdir -p logs
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
launchctl list | grep nanoclaw
```

## 11. Test

Tell the user (using the assistant name they configured):
> Send `@ASSISTANT_NAME hello` in your registered chat.

Check the logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

The user should receive a response in WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting**: Check `logs/nanoclaw.error.log`

**Container agent fails with "Claude Code process exited with code 1"**:
- Ensure Apple Container is running: `container system start`
- Check container logs: `cat groups/main/logs/container-*.log | tail -50`

**No response to messages**:
- Verify the trigger pattern matches (e.g., `@AssistantName` at start of message)
- Check that the chat JID is in `data/registered_groups.json`
- Check `logs/nanoclaw.log` for errors

**WhatsApp disconnected**:
- The service will show a macOS notification
- Run `npm run auth` to re-authenticate
- Restart the service: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw`

**Unload service**:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nanoclaw.plist
```
